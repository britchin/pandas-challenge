Heroes of Pymoli Written Analysis

Based on the data, men are playing this game much more than women, leading by  84% to 14% women. 

Ironically, although men in total spend more money on purchases, women are more likely (inividually) to spend money within the game than men
meaning women are likely more willing to spend money on the high ticket items vs buying lots of small ticket items (men).

Finally, in the purchase analysis by age, purchase count and total purchase value is significantly higher amongst the 20-24 age group. 
However, the avg total purchase per person in the same group is not the highest of the set. The highest in the set is in the 35-39 age group
with only 41 total purchase count. This could suggest that those in the 35-39 age group are buying larger ticket items vs smaller ticket 
items and could also suggest that those in the 20-24 age group purchase multiple smaller ticket items.
